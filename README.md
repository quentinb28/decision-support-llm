# Product Decision Support LLM

Help people follow through on what they know they should do.

Goal: Convert identity-level aspiration into decision-time constraints.

Identity → Value → Tradeoff
into
Context → Action → Execution

Alignment is the mechanism.

Decisive action is the buyable outcome.

Your entire growth engine becomes:

“This helped me finally do the thing I was avoiding.”

Which makes:

Referral and testimonial loops absolutely critical.

No behavior change → no growth.

Make or Break Question: “I acted sooner than I would have otherwise.”

Decision → Commitment → 48h Action → Reflection
