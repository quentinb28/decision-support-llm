# ALIGNMENT

## Close the Gap Between What You Know and What You Do

Alignment is a behavioral integration system designed to identify and reduce the gap between cognitive insight and real-world action.

Most users already know what they should do.

They:
- read
- reflect
- journal
- consume self-development content

Yet consistently:
- avoid difficult conversations
- delay execution
- seek approval
- break commitments
- act against their stated values

Alignment does not provide more insight.

It identifies where insight is not embodied and converts knowledge into behavioral commitments that can be trained in real-world contexts.

---

# Product Hypothesis

Users are not limited by lack of knowledge.

They are limited by:
- avoidance patterns
- identity-protective behaviors
- emotional discomfort
- nervous system resistance
- untrained implementation capacity

If users are shown where they consistently fail to act on what they already know, and are given constrained behavioral reps in real-life situations, their knowledge-action alignment will increase.

---

# Product Outcome

The user:
- becomes aware of recurring behavioral avoidance patterns
- commits to real-world embodiment targets
- performs daily behavioral reps
- tracks knowledge-action alignment
- installs new identity-consistent behavior over time

Success is defined as a reduced gap between intention and action.

# North Star Metric

## Integrity Score

Integrity Score is defined as:

**Integrity Score =**

(Number of situations where the user acted in alignment with the known best action)

divided by

(Number of situations where the user reported knowing the best action)

Measured weekly.

Target outcome:
Upward trend in Knowledge / Action Alignment percentage.

# Guardrail Metrics

To ensure the product drives action instead of reflection-only engagement:

- Daily Rep Completion Rate
- Commitment Follow-Through Rate
- Avoidance Pattern Detection Accuracy
- Time Between Insight and First Action
- Drop-off After Commitment Creation
- Weekly Re-Assessment Completion
- Reported Emotional Resistance Before Action
- Integrity Score Variance Over Time

Success must NOT be defined by:
- time in app
- content consumption
- number of reflections logged

# MVP Must Answer These Questions

For the user:

1. Where do I consistently know what to do but fail to act?
2. In which situations do I default to avoidance?
3. What behavior am I protecting through inaction?
4. What action am I currently unwilling to take?
5. What identity threat does this action create?
6. What specific real-world rep would move me forward?
7. Did I follow through when the moment occurred?
8. What resistance showed up before action?

# Main Features (MVP)

## 1. Pattern Assessment

Detect:
- dominant avoidance strategies
- identity-behavior conflicts
- emotional resistance triggers
- recurring decision failures

Outputs:
- Dominant Pattern
- Defense Strategy
- Growth Edge
- Avoided Behavior
- Identity Conflict

---

## 2. Tension Mapping

Detect situations where:

User Knowing does not equal User Doing

Examples:
- feedback conversations
- boundary setting
- health decisions
- execution tasks
- emotional regulation moments

---

## 3. Embodiment Target Generator

Convert insight into:

- a real-world behavioral rep
- a constraint
- a short-term commitment (7–14 days)

Example:

Target:
Express preference directly in one daily interaction.

Constraint:
No hedging language.

Reflection:
Track discomfort before action.

---

## 4. Daily Behavioral Reps

User receives:
- one real-world rep
- predicted discomfort level
- post-action reflection

Example:

Today’s Rep:
Decline one request without apology.

Predicted Discomfort Level:
6 out of 10

---

## 5. Integrity Tracking

Weekly Output:

User knew what to do: X times  
User acted on it: Y times  

Alignment Score = Y divided by X

---

## 6. Re-Assessment Loop

System re-evaluates:
- commitment success
- avoidance pattern shifts
- emotional resistance trends

Generates next embodiment target.

# Full User Journey

## Phase 1: Join
User signs up due to frustration with their own inaction.

---

## Phase 2: Assessment
System detects:
- behavioral avoidance
- identity conflict
- emotional resistance patterns

---

## Phase 3: Tension Mapping
User sees situations where they understand the correct action but do not perform it.

---

## Phase 4: Commitment Translation
System generates an Embodiment Target.

---

## Phase 5: Behavioral Training
User performs daily real-world reps.

---

## Phase 6: Integrity Tracking
System measures knowledge versus action alignment.

---

## Phase 7: Re-Assessment
System updates growth edge and next commitment.

- Integrity Score improves over 4 weeks
- Reduced delay between knowing and acting
- Users report lower pre-action resistance over time
- Repeat commitment cycles completed
