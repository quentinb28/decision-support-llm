# Core Success Event

Example:

User takes one real-world action within 48h toward a decision they had previously delayed.

Then define:

* What counts as a “decision”?
* What counts as an “action”?
* What’s verifiable vs self-reported?

This will drive:

Event tracking

Session design

Notification logic

Progress indicators

Your app’s internal logic should optimize toward increasing this event rate.
